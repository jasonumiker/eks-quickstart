Purpose

Example of a CodeBuild GitOps pattern where merging a change to the eks_cluster.py will trigger a
CodeBuild to invoke a cdk deploy of that change.

To provide GitHub credentials run:
aws codebuild import-source-credentials --server-type GITHUB --auth-type PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN --token <token_value>
